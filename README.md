# JustArrived API

Welcome to the, very unofficial, API backend for Just Arrived. Everything in this
project is completely open source and is built upon open source software.

The overall goal of this project is to have it become to backend for the matching
system. The API is designed to be consumed by multiple clients, so it is very
easy to implement a client (i.e Web/Android/iOS).
